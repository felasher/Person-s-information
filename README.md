# Person-s-information
Here's a Python class named Person with the required attributes and a method called introduce(). I have also created an instance of the Person class and called the introduce() method to display the person's information.
This code defines a Person class with a constructor that initializes the name, age, and gender attributes. The introduce() method prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender. An instance of the Person class is created with the name "John Doe", age 25, and gender "Male". Finally, the introduce() method is called on the instance to display the person's information.
